Hi Zhuoran Yang,

Thanks for your answer
I now understand better the existential nature of your results.

I have now a different question regarding a detail in the proof p. 38 bottom.
Here you use a lemma 5.15 [Vershynin 2010] on Z_j^2 to bound its mgf.
which means it has got to be centered. This however I cannot prove.

I have tried getting past this by centering and a few other schemes
but in every case I get a bound on E(Z_k^2) which is O(n).
This would invalidate the convergence because you end up with a
constant term greater than V_max^2 in the final bound.

I have checked the rest of the proof in detail and rewritten it for me thesis.
So far I did not find anything else that caused me trouble.
I hope you can spare another few moments to help me clarify this in my project.

Best regards,
Jacob Harder
