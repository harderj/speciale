Learning objectives:
- Describe definitions and theory on Reinforcement- and Q-Learning.
- Describe mathematically Artificial Neural Networks in relation to Q-Learning.
- Describe and analyze the function space foundation necessary in the topics mentioned above.
- Survey existing mathemathical results on Q-Learning, e.g. relating to success and convergence rates
- Analyze assumptions of these results and investigate if they can be changed
- Compare with similar results in Neural Networks
- Perspectivize the theory to empirical results

Project formulation:
Strong empirical results of Articifial Neural Networks (ANN) and Q-Learning (QL)
for certain problems, such as image recognition and board game strategies,
have appeared during the last 15 years.
Mathematical explaination of these results have been lacking
but recently many have tried to remedy this.
This project is about surveying and analyzing recent mathematical results about ANN and QL,
discussing their strength and relevance as well as the possibility of their improvement.
In the course of this, the function space foundations of the methods will be described and analyzed.
Finally the theorical results will be put in context
of the empirical results that motivated the project.
