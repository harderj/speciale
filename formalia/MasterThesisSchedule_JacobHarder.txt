Jacob Harder, 2020

Beginning: 30. November 2019 
Ending: 30. June 2020

Blok 3
Week 1:
- Describe setup, definitions, and theoretical aspects of reinforcement
  learning and Q-Learning.
Weeks 2-3:
- Describe mathematical aspects of Artificial Neural Networks in relation to Q-Learning.
weeks 4-5:
- Describe and analyze the function space foundation in the topics mentioned above.
Weeks 6-8:
- Survey existing mathemathical results on Q-Learning using deep neural
  networks, e.g. relating to success and convergence rates

Blok 4
Weeks 1-3:
- Analyze assumptions of these results and investigate if they can be changed
Week 4:
- Compare with similar results in the neural network litterature
Week 5:
- Perspectivize the theory to empirical results
Weeks 6-8:
- Rereading, error correction and hand-in of project
Weeks 9-10:
