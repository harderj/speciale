Learning objectives:
- Describe setup, definitions, and theoretical aspects of reinforcement
  learning and Q-Learning.
- Describe mathematical aspects of Artificial Neural Networks in relation to Q-Learning.
- Describe and analyze the function space foundation in the topics mentioned above.
- Survey existing mathemathical results on Q-Learning using deep neural
  networks, e.g. relating to success and convergence rates
- Analyze assumptions of these results and investigate if they can be changed
- Compare with similar results in the neural network litterature
- Perspectivize the theory to empirical results

Project formulation:
Strong empirical results of Articifial Neural Networks (ANN) and Q-Learning
(QL) for certain problems, such as image recognition and board game
strategies, have appeared during the last 15 years. Mathematical explaination
of these results have generally been sparse, however recent attempts aim to
remedy this. The project will survey and analyze recent mathematical results
on ANN and QL performance, discussing their strength and relevance as well as
the possibility of their improvement. In the course of this, the function
space foundations of the methods will be described and analyzed in detail.
Finally the theorical results will be put in context of the empirical results
that motivated the project.
