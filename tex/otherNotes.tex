\begin{defn} [Almost sure uniform convergence of random processes]
  A sequence of random processes $X_n : \Cal{X} \times \Omega \to \R$
  is said to converge \defemph{almost surely
  uniformly} to $X: \Cal{X} \times \Omega \to \R$ if and only if
  \[ \Prob(\sup_{x \in \Cal{X}} \abs{X_n(x) - X(x)} \to 0) = 1 \]
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} [Uniform convergence in probability of random processes]
  A sequence of random processes $X_n: \Cal{X} \times \Omega \to \R$
  is said to converge \defemph{uniformly
  in probability} to $X : \Cal{X} \times \Omega \to \R$ if and only if
  \[ \sup_{x \in \Cal{X}} \abs{X_n(x) - X(x)} \overset{P}{\to} 0 \]
\end{defn}
