This paper is mainly about Q-learning in the generality of continuous state
and action spaces.
We will present the theory necessary to discuss Q-learning in this generality,
a variety of settings in which Q-learning has been analysed
and the results of such analyses.
In the course of this we discuss the relations between the various settings
and their results.
Finally we will present and prove a yet unpublished result by
[Fan et. al]
about the convergence of fitted Q-iteration in a quite general
setting.
