\subsubsection{Suboptimality of policies}
Relating to decision processes and value functions
Through out the paper we discuss a wide array of
approximations of $Q^*$.
The default strategy is then to accept some close-enough approximation $\wt{Q}$
and then pick the greedy policy $\wt{pi}$ with respect to $\wt{Q}$.
We then measure our deviation from optimality in terms of the distance
$\norm{Q^* - \wt{Q}}_\infty$.
However we do not estimate the deviation of
$Q_{\wt{\pi}}$ from $Q^*$ which is actually a better measure
of the sub-optimality of $\wt{\pi}$ when comparing to $\pi^*$.
To this end it could be interesting to some how establish relations
between
$\norm{Q^* - Q_{\wt{\pi}}}_\infty$ and $\norm{Q^* - \wt{Q}}_\infty$.
