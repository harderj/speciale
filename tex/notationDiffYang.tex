% Notational differences between this paper
% and [YangXieWang]

Because $\sigma$ is used ambigously in \cref{thm:main}
we denote the probability distribution '$\sigma$'
from [YangXieWang, thm. 6.2, p. 20] by $\nu$ instead.

I dislike the shorthand defined in
[YangXieWang, p. 26 bottom]:
$\norm{f}_n^2 = 1/n \cdot \sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i)^2$.
This is partially due to inconsistencies and abuse of this notation
employed. For example
$\norm{f}_n$ is used as $1/n \sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i)$ as opposed another
likely interpretation $\sqrt{ \norm{f}_n^2 }$, whereas
$\norm{f}_n^{-1}$ is used to mean $1/(\norm{f}_n)$.
This is avoided by using finite dimensional $p$-norms instead.
The conversion to my notation thus becomes
$\norm{f}_n \leadsto \norm{f}_1/n$,
$\norm{f}_n^2 \leadsto \norm{f}^2/n$,
$\norm{f}_n^{-1} \leadsto n \norm{f}_1^{-1}$.
