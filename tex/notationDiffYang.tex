% Notational differences between this paper
% and [YangXieWang]

Because $\sigma$ is used ambigously in \cref{thm:main}
we denote the probability distribution $\sigma$
from [YangXieWang, thm. 6.2, p. 20] by $\nu$ instead.

I avoid the shorthand defined in
[YangXieWang, p. 26 bottom]:
$\norm{f}_n^2 = 1/n \cdot \sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i)^2$.
and use $p$-norms instead.
The conversion to my notation thus becomes
$\norm{f}_n \leadsto \norm{f}/n$.
