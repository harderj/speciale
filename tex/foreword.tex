I came upon the idea to write about Q-learning when
I was fascinated by the performance of the algorithms
implemented by \mcite{M15}.

Coming from a mathematical background
my main purpose of this master thesis was initially
to investigate what has been proven
about the convergence of Q-learning algorithms
and what mathematical theory is relevant to establish such proofs.
In particular Q-learning algorithms using
artificial neural networks.

In the course of this I discovered that the frameworks
and settings in which various Q-leaning algorithms are analysed
varies greatly across litterature.
Also questions as to in which degree optimal strategies
exist in these various frameworks turns out to be
non-trivial when the state and action spaces are uncountable.

Therefore this paper is partially about building a framework
for analysing Q-learning algorithms in a variety of settings.
And partially to present the results that occur in each setting
and discuss their importance and generality.
