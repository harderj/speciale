The proof of \cref{thm:main} combines two results.
The first on the error propagation and the second on the error
ocurring in a single step.
\input{errorpropthm}
It is in the second theorem (\ref{thm:oneStep})
on the one-step approximation error
that we deviate slightly from \ncite{F20} by correcting some mistakes.
We will note these deviations as they occur in the proof.
\input{onestepthm}
The proofs of \cref{thm:errorprop} and \cref{thm:oneStep} are
found below, but first 
we will show how to combine them to obtain
\cref{thm:main}.
