The proof of \cref{thm:main} combines two results.
The first on the error propagation and the second on the error
ocurring in a single step.
\input{errorpropthm}
\input{onestepthm}
The proofs of \cref{thm:errorprop} and \cref{thm:oneStep} are
found below, but first 
we will show how to combine them to obtain
\cref{thm:main}.
\input{mainProof}
Now for \cref{thm:errorprop}.
\input{C1proof}
Finally we show \cref{thm:oneStep}.
\input{C2proof}
